Get MarginBank Balance
===
The method [getMarginBankBalance](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/a96dd1167cddc80b76cb73a0499a112e325ca9ec/src/fireflyClient.ts#L151) allows users to check their USDC balance deposited into the exchange. 

Notably this balance will only be the currently available margin in the user's account and will not include any margin being used to collateralize open positions. Open positions must be closed before the margin collateralizing them, along with any profit or loss, is transferred back to the MarginBank balance. 

Furthermore, this returned balance does not account for open orders. Given open orders are tracked only in the off-chain orderbook, balance used to collateralize them is not yet accounted for in the on-chain balance. Withdrawing funds from the Margin Bank before cancelling open orders will result in the open orders being force cancelled.

To see the balance with accounting for off-chain orders and on-chain positions, please instead use Free Collateral from the [Get Account Data](2/4.user-account-data) route. (Recommended).

- **ContractAddress:** (Optional) address of MarginBank contract. If not provided, will be reading Margin Bank contract address from [contractAddresses](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/36aca76abd1c1829179674c8859f87eb15fa80f1/src/fireflyClient.ts#L93) fetched while initialization.

  ```bash
    console.log("MarginBank Balance: ", await client.getMarginBankBalance());
  ```

### Returns
The USDC MarginBank balance of the user.
