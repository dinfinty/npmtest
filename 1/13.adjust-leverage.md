# Adjust Leverage

All orders for a given market must be placed at the same leverage as the user set market leverage. The **adjustLeverage** method allows users to update the market leverage. 

Note that you should cancel all open orders before updating leverage. This method will force cancel any remaining open orders at the previous market leverage. 

- **Market Symbol:** Symbol of the market in format "{ASSET_SYMBOL}-PERP" eg: "BTC-PERP", "ETH-PERP"

- **Leverage:** The new leverage for the market in base number format

- **Perpetual Contract Address:**  (Optional) address of Perpetual contract for the market. If not provided, the perpetual contract address for the given market will be read from [contractAddresses](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/36aca76abd1c1829179674c8859f87eb15fa80f1/src/fireflyClient.ts#L93) fetched while initialization.
