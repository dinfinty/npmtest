Create Signed Order
===
Note the [postOrder](2/16.post-signed-order) method, detailed later, will internally take care of signing orders by invoking this method. We recommend using `postOrder` for simplest interaction with the API. **(Recommended)**


The method [createSignedOrder](https:#github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/3f45a98eaf2e3b57079135ba5fd23ac9a1704581/src/fireflyClient.ts#L249) allows user to generate order signatures. The signatures are used to verify authenticity of the order at the time of trade being settled on-chain. 

When an order submitted by a user is routed through the order matching engine, the matching engine, not the user, will submit the order on-chain as part of a trade and therefore the signature is critical to verify the authenticity of the user's order request.

The method takes the following input params:

- **OrderSignatureRequest:** An interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
    interface OrderSignatureRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market for which to create order
      price: number; # price at which to place order. Will be zero for a market order
      quantity: number; # quantity/size of the order
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # BUY/SELL
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; #MARKET/LIMIT
      leverage?: number; # leverage must be an integer value and match the user set market leverage
      reduceOnly?: boolean; # order should only reduce a position, default False
      salt?: number; # random number for uniqueness of order. Generated randomly if not provided.
      expiration?: number; # time at which order will expire. Will be set to 1 month if not provided.
    }
  ```
  All number inputs are expected in base format and will be converted to big number strings internally by the library. 

### Returns
The `OrderSignatureResponse` interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
    interface OrderSignatureResponse {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market for which to create order
      price: number; # the price to create order at
      quantity: number; # the quantity of order 
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # the side of the order
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; #MARKET/LIMIT order type
      leverage: number; # the order leverage
      reduceOnly: boolean; # indicates whether the order is reduce only or not
      salt: number; #  a unique number 
      expiration: number; # timestamp of when this order should expire
      orderSignature: string; # the order signature
    }
  ```
