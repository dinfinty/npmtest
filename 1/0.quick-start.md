# Quick Start

A quick start snippet to hit the ground running if you're familiar with Firefly's on-chain protocol. Read on to learn more about each individual method used here and many others.

If you haven't already, please start by adding the library to your node project by running ` npm i@firefly-exchange/firefly-client ` or ` yarn add @firefly-exchange/firefly-client `.

  ```js
  import {
    Networks,
    FireflyClient,
    MARKET_SYMBOLS,
    ORDER_SIDE,
    ORDER_TYPE,
  } from "@firefly-exchange/firefly-client";

    const dummyAccountKey =
      "a182091b4d5a090b65d604e36f68629a692e3bf2aa864bd3f037854034cdd676";

    const client = new FireflyClient(true, Networks.TESTNET, dummyAccountKey); 
    await client.init() // initialize wallet & signer objects

    // Only Testnet
    await client.fundGas(); // mint gas tokens on testnet
    await client.mintTestUSDC(); // mint test usdc on testnet
    
    // Deposit USDC into Firefly's on-chain MarginBank contract
    const usdcBalance = await client.getUSDCBalance();
    await client.depositToMarginBank(usdcBalance); 
    console.log( "Balance available on Firefly: ", await client.getMarginBankBalance());

    // Add BTC market to client
    await client.addMarket(MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC); // initialize internal market signer objects
    await client.adjustLeverage(MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC, 10) // adjust market leverage to 10x
    const btcLeverage = await client.getUserDefaultLeverage(MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC);
  
    // Post a market order for 0.1 BTC
    const response = await client.postOrder({
      clientId: "1-my-first-order",
      symbol: MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC, // asset to be traded
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE.MARKET,
      price: 0, // 0 implies market order 
      quantity: 0.1, // the amount of asset to trade
      side: ORDER_SIDE.SELL, // buy or sell
      leverage: btcLeverage, // order must be at same leverage as market
      postOnly: true, // order should only be a maker
    });
  
    console.log("Post order response: ", response.data);
  ```
