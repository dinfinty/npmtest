Create Order Cancellation Signature
===
Note, the [postCancel](2/.19.post-cancel-order) method, detailed later, will internally take care of signing cancellations by invoking this method and is the recommended approach for the simplest interaction with the API. **(Recommended)**


The method [createOrderCancellationSignature](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/bcff996096acc7bdb1553dfbd47baaf5b6322f51/src/fireflyClient.ts#L333) allows user to create cancellation signatures for the provided orders. Similar to creating orders, signatures are used to validate the authenticity of the request since the order must be cancelled off-chain on the orderbook before being cancelled on-chain. 

- **OrderCancelSignatureRequest:** A custom defined interface having following fields:
  ```bash
    interface OrderCancelSignatureRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # symbol of market to which order belongs to
      hashes: string[]; # hash of the orders to be cancelled.
    }
  ```
  The order hash parameter passed to `orderCancellationSignature` method is returned as part of the `PlaceOrderResponse` or can be obtained via the get user order routes.

  ```bash
    const cancelSignature = await client.createOrderCancellationSignature({
      symbol: MARKET_SYMBOLS.DOT,
      hashes: ["0x4920c512d0254c1e5f5a0543329d20549cbe7fead28dd852fd04535c79b62f90"],
    });
  ```
