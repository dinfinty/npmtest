Place Cancel Order
===
Note, the [postCancel](2/.19.post-cancel-order) method, detailed later, will internally take care of creating signatures and passing them to this method and is the recommended approach for the simplest interaction with the API. **(Recommended)**


The method [placeCancelOrder](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/bcff996096acc7bdb1553dfbd47baaf5b6322f51/src/fireflyClient.ts#L355) allows users to place cancellation order requests to the exchange API. The cancellation signature must first be generated as a pre-requisite to this method.

- **OrderCancellationRequest:** A custom defined interface having following fields:
  ```bash
    interface OrderCancellationRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # symbol of market to which order belongs to
      hashes: string[]; # hash of the orders to be cancelled.
      signature: string; # cancellation signature generated using createOrderCancellationSignature
    }
  ```
  This `OrderCancellationRequest` extends the previous `OrderCancelSignatureRequest` requiring one additional field - the signature.

  ```bash
    const cancellationResponse = await client.placeCancelOrder({
      symbol: MARKET_SYMBOLS.DOT,
      hashes: ["0x4920c512d0254c1e5f5a0543329d20549cbe7fead28dd852fd04535c79b62f90"],
      signature: cancelSignature,
    });
  ```
