# Remove Markets

A market previously added to client object can be removed using [removeMarket](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/226e610fd78c1ef945a82261101b661b09859e5a/src/fireflyClient.ts#L127)
. The method takes the following params:

- **Market Symbol:** Symbol of the market in format "{ASSET_SYMBOL}-PERP" eg: "BTC-PERP", "ETH-PERP"

The function will remove the signer object of the market from the internal signer map. Once removed the user won't be able to place orders of the removed market. The market must be added back to client before any new orders can be posted. The method also unsubscribes the global event listener for the removed market.

```bash
  console.log("Market Removed: ", client.removeMarket(MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC));
```

### Returns

The function returns a boolean indicating whether the market was successfully removed. If a non-existent market is removed, the method returns false.
