# Client Initialization

The client initialization create a wallet object to make on-chain contract calls & signer objects to sign off-chain payload such as orders. The following parameters are required for [initialization](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/effc3b322cd2f82da5d33922cd2df48cc1ea2bb6/src/fireflyClient.ts#L106):

- **Is Term Accepted:** It is a boolean value indicating that you accept the [terms and conditions](https://firefly.exchange/terms-of-use) of firefly exchange. Passing this value `true` lets you use the authorized routes of the exchange.

    [Terms of Use](), [Privacy Policy]() & [Important Disclosures](),
    You agree to the following:
    - You donâ€™t reside in, are a citizen of, are located in, or have registered office in the US or any restricted territory
    - You are not using a VPN to circumvent these restrictions
    - You are in compliance with your local jurisdictional laws when trading on Firefly
    - You understand that Firefly is in a beta launch state, and that trading on Firefly may involve in partial or total loss of your investment

- **Network:** An object with the following interface:

    ```code
    interface Network {
        url: string;
        chainId: number;
        apiGateway: string;
        socketURL: string;
        onboardingUrl:string;
    }
    ```

    - `url` is the RPC URL of the block chain on which exchange protocol is deployed.
    - `chainId` is the id of the block chain
    - `apiGateway` this is the url of firefly's api gateway, which accepts incoming user api calls and forwards to orderbook
    - `socketURL`: url at which users can listen emitted events from apiGateway
    - `onboardingUrl`: url used to generate authToken for off chanin end-point (e.g.: user preferences)<br>

    The client library package exposes a constant `Network` containing network information about the TESTNET and MAINNET, which can be imported and used to initialize the client instance.
    ```bash
        import {Networks} from "@firefly-exchange/firefly-client";

        console.log(Networks.TESTNET)
        # will output
        # url: "https://bobabase.boba.network/",
        # chainId: 1297,
        # apiGateway: "https://dapi-testnet.firefly.exchange",
        # socketURL: "wss://dapi-testnet.firefly.exchange",
        # onboardingUrl: "https://testnet.firefly.exchange"
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you may define and connect to a custom network:

    ```bash
        const customNetwork: Network = {
            url: "https://bobabase.boba.network/",
            chainId: 1297,
            apiGateway: "https://dapi-testnet.firefly.exchange",
            socketURL: "wss://dapi-testnet.firefly.exchange",
            onboardingUrl: "https://testnet.firefly.exchange"
        };

        const clientCustomNetwork = new FireflyClient(true, customNetwork, dummyAccountKey); 
    ```


- **Account Private Key:**  The private key of the account that will be used for trading. Bobabeam, the L2 Blockchain on which Firefly is deployed, is an EVM compatible chain and uses the same private/public key structure as Ethereum. 

    The client library solely uses this private key to create a signer object to create orders on-chain & sign on-chain transaction **- it is never exposed outside this signer object or transmitted.**
