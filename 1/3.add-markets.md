# Add Markets

When the client object is instantiated, a user cannot yet use it to post orders to a given market.
The user must first add markets to the client instance using [addMarket](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/73a7ab0034d1e674da0b85f88c040dc838bdb967/src/fireflyClient.ts#L107). The method takes the following params:

- **Market Symbol:** Symbol of the market in format "{ASSET_SYMBOL}-PERP" eg: "BTC-PERP", "ETH-PERP"

- **Orders Contract Address:** An optional parameter of type string pointing to orders contract of the market provided. Each market has a separate orders contract deployed for it. This contract is responsible for creating signed orders and validating the signatures.

  - If the param is not provided, the method tries to search for Orders contract address in [contractAddresses](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/36aca76abd1c1829179674c8859f87eb15fa80f1/src/fireflyClient.ts#L93)
  - If the market provided does not exist or the Orders contract is not in `contractAddresses`, the method will throw an error
  - If a custom orders contract address is provided, the method does not perform any lookup to `contractAddresses` and uses the provided contract address

  ```bash
    # adds DOT Market with default contract address
    console.log("Market Added: ", client.addMarket(MARKET_SYMBOLS.BTC));
  ```

### Returns

The function returns a boolean indicating whether the market was added successfully. If the market already exists/added to client, the returned value will be false.
