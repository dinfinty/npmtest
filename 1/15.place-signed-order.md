Place Signed Order
===
Note the [postOrder](2/16.post-signed-order) method, detailed later, will internally take care of signing orders and passing them to this method. We recommend using `postOrder` for simplest interaction with the API. **(Recommended)**

The method [placeSignedOrder](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/35a8f5d6c51173935ad41bc3aa9733cb97cd237a/src/fireflyClient.ts#L289) allows users to place a signed order to the off-chain orderbook.

The method takes as input the following parameters:

- **PlaceOrderRequest:** An interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
    interface PlaceOrderRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market for which to create order
      price: number; # price at which to place order. Will be zero for a market order
      quantity: number; # quantity/size of order
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # BUY/SELL
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; #MARKET/LIMIT
      leverage: number; # leverage must be an integer value, default is 1. Check market info for max allowed leverage
      reduceOnly: boolean; # if the order was reduce only or not
      salt: number; # a random number 
      expiration: number; # order expiry time
      orderSignature: string; # signature of order created using create signed order method
      timeInForce?: TIME_IN_FORCE; # GTC/FOK/IOC by default all orders are GTC
      postOnly?: boolean; # true/false, default is true
      clientId?: string; #any unique id you want to give to your order
    }
  ```
  PlaceOrderRequest basically extends the `OrderSignatureResponse`, by adding two optional fields, `timeInForce`, `clientId` and `postOnly`. The object returned from `createSignedOrder` can be passed as input to this method, along with these optional fields. 

  ```bash
    # will output the signed order response
    const response = await client.placeSignedOrder(signedOrder);
    console.log(response.data);
  ```

### Returns
The `PlaceOrderResponse` interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
     interface PlaceOrderResponse {
      id: number; # a unique incremental id assigned to each order by orderbook
      clientId: string; # information about the client browser / unique id user provided
      requestTime: number; # timestamp at which order request was made
      cancelReason: CANCEL_REASON; # if the order was cancelled, what the reason was
      orderStatus: ORDER_STATUS; # status of placed order
      hash: string; # unique hash of the order
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market on which order is placed
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; # MARKET/LIMIT
      timeInForce: TIME_IN_FORCE; # GTC/FOK/etc..
      userAddress: string; # address of user (lower-cased)
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # BUY/SELL
      price: string; # price of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      quantity: string; # quantity of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      leverage: string; # leverage of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      reduceOnly: boolean; # if the order was reduce only
      expiration: number; # timestamp at which order will get expired
      salt: number; # a random number 
      orderSignature: string; # signature of the order
      filledQty: string; # if the order was partially or fully filled, its filled quantity
      avgFillPrice: string; # the average price at which order was filled
      makerFee: string; # the amount of fee paid by the user as marker on this order
      takerFee: string; # the amount of fee paid by the user as taker on this order 
      createdAt: number; # timestamp at which order was stored in db
