Post Cancel Order
===
The method [postCancelOrder](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/bcff996096acc7bdb1553dfbd47baaf5b6322f51/src/fireflyClient.ts#L368) is a wrapper around the `createOrderCancellationSignature` and `placeCancelOrder` methods, simplifying the order placement down to one method call for the client. **(Recommended)**

- **OrderCancelSignatureRequest:** An interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
    interface OrderCancellationRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # symbol of market to which order belongs to
      hashes: string[]; # hash of the orders to be cancelled.
    }
  ```
