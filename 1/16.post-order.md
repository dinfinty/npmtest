Post Order
===
The method [postOrder](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/bcff996096acc7bdb1553dfbd47baaf5b6322f51/src/fireflyClient.ts#L317) is a wrapper around the `createSignedOrder` and `placeSignedOrder` methods, simplifying the order placement to the off-chain orderbook down to one method call for the client. **(Recommended)**

The method takes as input the following params:

- **PostOrderRequest:** An interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
    interface PostOrderRequest {
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market for which to create order
      price: number; # price at which to place order. Will be zero for a market order
      quantity: number; # quantity/size of order
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # BUY/SELL
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; #MARKET/LIMIT
      leverage?: number; # leverage must be an integer value and match the user set market leverage
      reduceOnly?: boolean; # order should only reduce a position, default False
      salt?: number; # random number for uniqueness of order. Generated randomly if not provided
      expiration?: number; # time at which order will expire. Will be set to 1 month if not provided
      timeInForce?: TIME_IN_FORCE; # GTC/FOK/IOC by default all orders are GTC
      postOnly?: boolean; # true/false, default is true
      clientId?: string; # an optional field set by the user
    }
  ```
    All number inputs are expected in base format and will be converted to big number strings internally by the library. 


### Returns
The `PlaceOrderResponse` interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
     interface PlaceOrderResponse {
      id: number; # a unique incremental id assigned to each order by orderbook
      clientId: string; # information about the client browser
      requestTime: number; # timestamp at which order request was made
      cancelReason: CANCEL_REASON; # if the order was cancelled, what the reason was

      hash: string; # unique hash of the order
      symbol: MarketSymbol; # market on which order is placed
      orderType: ORDER_TYPE; # MARKET/LIMIT

      userAddress: string; # address of user (lower-cased)
      side: ORDER_SIDE; # BUY/SELL
      price: string; # price of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      quantity: string; # quantity of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      leverage: string; # leverage of the order. This is big number string in base x 10^18 format
      reduceOnly: boolean; # if the order was reduce only
      expiration: number; # timestamp at which order will get expired
