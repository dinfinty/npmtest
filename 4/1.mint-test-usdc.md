Mint Test USDC
===
The method [mintTestUSDC](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/3778d5256853dcaabd8ff3599c3d0a51167cc291/src/fireflyClient.ts#L166) allows user to mint test USDC on the USDC contract on TESTNET. 

This method requires that you have some gas tokens in your wallet already. See [Fund Test Gas](4/2.fund-test-gas.md).

A separate call must be made to deposit the minted funds into the exchange's MarginBank contract before the funds can be used to create orders and perform trades. See [Deposit Funds To MarginBank](1/8.deposit-to-margin-bank).

This method does not work on mainnet.

The method takes the following params as input:

- **ContractAddress:** (Optional) address of USDC contract to mint tokens on. If not provided, will be reading USDC contract address from [contractAddresses](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/36aca76abd1c1829179674c8859f87eb15fa80f1/src/fireflyClient.ts#L93) fetched while initialization.

```bash
  console.log("Tokens minted:", await client.mintTestUSDC());
```

### Returns
A boolean indicating whether the tokens were minted successfully.
