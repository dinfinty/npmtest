Fund Test Gas
===
The method [fundGas](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/ee3fbf47989ba53fe5d27a70343046f5d4205bf1/src/fireflyClient.ts#L246) allows user to fund gas tokens on TESTNET.

Gas tokens are required for on-chain calls such as MarginBank deposit, MarginBank withdraw, Position addMargin, Position removeMargin and Position adjustLeverage. Gas tokens are not required to create or delete orders.

This method does not work on mainnet. 

All gas fees on mainnet will be sponsored by Firefly Foundation, as such no gas tokens will be needed.

The method does not take any input.

  ```bash
    console.log("Gas:", await client.fundGas());
  ```

### Returns
The `FundGasResponse` interface with the following fields:
  ```bash
     interface FundGasResponse {
        message: string 
     }
  ```
