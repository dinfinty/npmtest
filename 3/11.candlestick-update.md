Candlestick Update Socket
===

[onCandleStickUpdate](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/firefly-client/blob/8aaf8bfac12992c3824ed24510ba89b8da8f346f/src/exchange/sockets.ts#L117) socket is triggered whenever trade happens on exchange and if trade is not permormed it triggers after a specified time interval right now 10 seconds.

1. open up socket connection using `client.sockets.open()` The user must ensure to terminate the connection when all work is done using `client.sockets.close()`

2. `onCandleStickUpdate` is the global update event, we will subscribe to `client.sockets.subscribeGlobalUpdatesBySymbol(markeySymbol)`

3. Once subscription to room is created, we will write a callback function and pass it as argument to the event listener like this:
``` bash
    const callback = (candle : MinifiedCandleStick) => {
        console.log(candle);
    };

    const symbol = MARKET_SYMBOLS.DOT
    const interval = "1m"

    client.sockets.onCandleStickUpdate(symbol,interval,callback);
```
- symbol: is the market symbol for which user wishes to get candle stick update.
- interval: at the time of writing the docs, exchange supports following intervals: `"1m", "3m", "5m", "15m", "30m", "1h", "2h", "4h", "6h", "8h", "12h", "1d", "1w", "1M"`
