Listening To Events
===

The client library exposes a public member `client.sockets` that allows any one to start listening to exchange events. Before any event could be listening to user must:
1. open up socket connection using `client.sockets.open()` The user must ensure to terminate the connection when all work is done using `client.sockets.close()`

2. subscribe to global market room, if user wishes to listen to global events using `client.sockets.subscribeGlobalUpdatesBySymbol(markeySymbol)`. For every market that the user wishes to get connected to and listen events for this method must be invoked separately.

3. subscribe to local user events room, if user wishes to listen to events pertaining to himself using `client.sockets.subscribeUserUpdateByAddress(userAddress)`

4. Once subscription to room is created, the user can then write a callback function and pass it as argument to any of the event listeners described on previous page like this:
``` bash
    const callback = ({ order }: { order: PlaceOrderResponse }) => {
        console.log(order);
    };

    client.sockets.onUserOrderUpdate(callback);
```

**Note:** Its observed that often room subscription take some time, so please sleep for 1 second before performing any action or timeout in order to be able to listen the events, else the event could be missed.
