===

The function [getUserOrders](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/9de8442be50a074212f962bb3ef74899a3955766/src/fireflyClient.ts#L402) allows caller to get their orders on exchange. The function takes the following input:

- **GetOrderRequest:** A custom defined interface having following fields:
  ```bash
    interface GetOrderRequest {
      symbol?: MarketSymbol; 
      pageSize?: number; 
      pageNumber?: number; 
      statuses: ORDER_STATUS;
    }
  ```
    - symbol:is the market symbol for which user wishes to get orders. If not provided returned orders will belong to all markets
    - pageSize: is the number of records required per page. The exchange server allows maximum of 50 orders per page and is the default page size.
    - pageNumber: is used to fetch order from a particular page number. Per page there are 50 orders so if a user has 100 filled orders, he must call the method twice with page number being 1 and 2 to get all 50 orders
    - statuses: is the status of orders required.
