Get User Positions
===

The function [getUserPosition](https://github.com/fireflyprotocol/FireflyClient/blob/9de8442be50a074212f962bb3ef74899a3955766/src/fireflyClient.ts#L418) allows caller to get their current open position on exchange.

- **GetPositionRequest:** A custom defined interface having following fields:
  ```bash
    interface GetPositionRequest {
      symbol?: MarketSymbol;
      pageSize?: number;
      pageNumber?: number;
    }
  ```
    - symbol:is the market symbol for which user wishes to get its open position. If not provided then will return open position across all markets
    - pageSize: is the number of records required per page. The exchange server allows maximum of 50 records per trade. If total markets are 75 and user has open position across all of them, the returned response will only contain 50 open positions
    - pageNumber: is used to fetch open positions from a particular page number. Per page there are 50 records so if a user has 100 open positions across 100 markets, he must call the method twice with page number being 1 and 2 to get all 100 positions
