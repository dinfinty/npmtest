      endTime?: number;
      pageSize?: number;
      pageNumber?: number;

    - symbol:is the market symbol for which user wishes to get its open position. If not provided then will return open position across all markets

    - fromId: each trade is given an incremental id, provide the id to get trades after provided id

    - pageSize: is the number of records required per page. The exchange server allows maximum of 50 records per trade.
