# Amounts

Firefly uses 18 decimal to represent all numbers. The base amount must be shifted by 18 decimals before sending it to on-chain contracts. 

Most library methods abstract the need for shifting away from the user; however, where needed util methods such as `bnStrToBaseNumber` are exposed to easily shift between the two.

For example:

- A trade of 2 ETH at price 2,232.11 USDC will be represented as `2 x 10^18` and `2232.11 x 10^18` respectively on chain
- Assuming a user has a balance of 400 USDC, querying the on-chain USDC balance will return `400 x 10^18`, it must be un-shifted by 18 decimals to yield 400 USDC
